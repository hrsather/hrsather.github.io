						<h1>How I built this website</h1>
						<p>As someone who avoids web dev like the plague</p>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="../../images/website.png" alt="" /></div>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>It is no secret that I am not the biggest fan of web development. I have endless respect for those who are willing to
					   spend countless hours attempting to center a text box, but I simply do not have the will-power to sit through that.
					   In the summer of 2018, I was a full-stack web developer intern for Tyler Technologies. Although I loved the company and all of
					   the employees, I found myself more interested in the hardware and data behind the whole system rather than how pretty
					   the matte icons were.
					</p>

					<h2>Goal</h2>
					<p>It is becoming more and more apparent these days how important it is to have an online presence
					   and showcase projects and blog posts when looking for a CS job. So, I decided to boot up the old html and throw
					   something together. This website is simply a platform that contains all of my projects, blog posts, and more verbose 
					   ways for me to communicate without adding to the already over-bloated LinkedIn. Hopefully, others can follow the
					   relatively easy steps that I did and create a website of their own.
					</p>

					<h2>Conditions</h2>
					<p>Before I started, I knew that I had a few conditions that needed to be met. 
						<ol>
							<li>It had to be hosted for free</li>
							<li>I wanted to customize it via actual web dev tools</li>
							<li>NO PHP!</li>
						</ol>
						A quick google search showed me that <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> offers to host a personal website for its users for free. Another quick
						google search showed that there are great templates for personal webpages online. I went with <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>
						because they were free, didn't require an account, and had great templates. The template that I decided on,
						<a href="https://html5up.net/massively">MASSIVELY</a> looked nice and did not use PHP, which I am afraid to try based on hearing
						horror stories.
					</p>

					<h2>Development</h2>
					<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
					<p>GitHub pages worked great with this project. It is set up very similarly to how a standard repo is set up.
					   Their page does a great job of explaining it, so I will just link it <a href="https://pages.github.com/">HERE</a>.
					   Don't do any steps after you clone the repo to your machine. Make sure that you don't make any files besides the README.md,
					   if you want that.
					   <a href="https://github.com/hrsather/hrsather.github.io">Source Code</a>
					</p>
					<h3>Downloading Templates</h3>
					<p>As stated above, templates can be downloaded from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. A zipped version of the 
					   projects source code is downloaded. Unzip this in the empty repo that you just downloaded from GitHub. Once you push the 
					   code, you can then access your website anywhere at the link username.github.io.
					</p>
					<h3>Editing the Source Code</h3>
					<p>This is the hard, but fun part. You can customize the website exactly how you want it, even with no html or coding experience.
					   There are plenty of great html tutorials to help online, but the main things to keep in mind are that
					    <ol>
							<li>The "index.html" file is the main file</li>
							<li>The other generic.html and reference.html files are the different pages that you can click on</li>
							<li>The images, text, colors, and pretty much everything can be changed exactly how you want it</li>
							<li>The href="../name.html" pieces of code you see are hypertext references that take you to different pages on clicks</li>
						</ol>
						My source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/hrsather/hrsather.github.io">HERE</a>. Feel free to use it towards
						your own website! The only steps now are to explore the code and design your website. Happy hacking!
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					I never thought that I'd say this but it was actually quite nice to get back to web dev for a bit. It was 
					refreshing to touch up on old skills, and I also learned a few new things along the way. It is much different 
					working on a 5 GB production giant than it is to work on a 10 file program. I was able to see how the elements 
					interact with each other directly, rather than having a whole bunch of API's do all the work. Overall, I am
					very happy that I took on this project. I certainly hope to add more to it. I want to get on a regular schedule 
					of blogging and working on side projects and this website will be at the center of it. Thank you so much for still 
					reading and I hope you come back for more content!
