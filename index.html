				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Hayden_Sather.jpg" alt="" /></span> Hello, and thank you for coming to my page! My name is Hayden Sather and I am currently a graduate student at 
				the Colorado School of Mines. I am pursuing two M.S. degrees - Data Science and Computer Science. Although my passion is with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am constantly
				learning many tangentially related fields that interest me as well. This includes graphics, networking, game theory, information theory, leadership and others.
				<br/><br/> I approach life the same way that I approached my career as a NCAA decathlete for my college's track team: Be a Jack of all trades, and a master in one. As a decathlete, I was
				required to compete in 10 different track and Field events every weekend. It is impossible to master all 10 events, so I had to accept just being adept at the majority of them, then excel
				at the few that I happened to be better at.
				<br/><br/> A very interesting thing happened when I started training for the decathlon. Since my time was split between 10 events, I obviously wasn't improving as quickly as I would have been
				if I just focused on one event. But, I noticed that the time that I spent training for each event became much more efficient, and I was able to achieve a lot of progress in the relatively
				short amount of time that I was training. My training in my seperate events confounded and helped me improve at a higher rate versus if I were to just work on one event solo.
				<br/><br/> In athletics, this is called "cross-training". This is when an athlete trains in multiple different ways to make it so they are more athletic in general, which then helps their
				main sport. This is quite common in the business world as well. Leaders will describe themselves as "T-Shaped", which means that they are competent in a broad array of subjects (the top bar of
				the "T"), but then are an expert in one or two subjects (Ths vertical bar). This allows for them to approach new problems with a wide variety of lenses because they are familiar with many more
				ways of problem solving than someone who just has the vertical bar without the breadth in multiple subjects.
				<br/><br/> If you, the reader, happens to be well-versed in data science, you may notice that this strikes an uncanny resemblance to the topic of over-fitting. Just like a statistical model
				can over-fit to a dataset and perform poor on new data, an athlete can "over-fit" to a certain event and perform poor on new events. As a decathlete, I may never win 1st place in any individual
				event, I am confident that I will be top 5 in any of my 10 events. I try and continue this philosophy into my data science career. I want to be aware of as many fields remotely related to 
				data science as I can so that given a new problem, I can generalize and view the problem from multiple different angles that I would not have had if I were to just study data science. 
				<br/><br/> The point of my personal projects and blog is to document my journey towards this goal. I am no expert in anything, I am not a writer, I may even be boring, but I hope that some 
				people can find value out of this. If you read this far, thank you, and I hope you enjoy some of the things that I do! </I></p>
